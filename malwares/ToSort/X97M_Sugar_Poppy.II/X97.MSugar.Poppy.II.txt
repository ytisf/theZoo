PRESS RELEASE: 

Excel 97 Class Object Infection Announced 

OPIATEVILLE, CANADA (dAP), 3rd December 1998 In a stunning achievement the noted virus researcher, VicodinES, was able to develop a class object virus for Excel 97 in less then 2 hours. I was surprised at how much virus friendly code there is in the Excel VBA stated VicodinES, no matter how many times I sit down and look at Office 97 I can still find new ways to infect it. 

The new virus, called Sugar.Poppy, is able to infect all class objects in Excel 97. This means that both the ThisWorkbook object and Sheets objects can be infected. I didn’t even use any auto-macros, Excel 97 supports nearly 25 event macros in it’s class section VicodinES said as he described this new virus to me over the phone.  This reporters test sample was able to replicate to all 3 of my goat spreadsheets without error. The virus was able to copy itself to every single class object  for example in a workbook with 4 sheets the virus infected each sheet (1-4) and the ThisWorkbook object. 

During our conversion VicodinES mentioned that a press release might be warranted at this time so that Anti-Virus companies could adjust their scanning engines BEFORE there is a problem. He related to me a story about when he announced Word 97 class object infection and NAI didn’t bother to update their engine till nearly eight months after the release of Class.Poppy. This simple oversight meant that all NAI users were completely helpless if they became infected with Class.Poppy. They wouldn’t be able to detect the virus nor could they clean it. I was surprised at this revelation and called NAI for a comment but their public relations department did not return my call. 

When asked about being retired from virus writing VicodinES started cursing loudly into the phone and yelling about warm diet soda, then the phone hung up. I can only assume that meant that he didn’t want to discuss that subject.
