Stoned Family

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These are dangerous memory resident boot viruses. They infect the first physical sectors of the disks - the boot sector of the floppy disks and the MBR of the hard drive. Some of these viruses are stealth ones. 
While loading from an infected disk they decrease the size of the system memory (the word at the address 0000:0413), hook INT 13h and then infect the floppy disks that are accessed. While loading from an infected floppy disk they infect the MBR of the hard drive. 

While infecting a disk they save the original boot and MBR sectors to the not used or to the seldom-used areas on the disks. While infecting the hard drive the viruses save the original MBR to the one of the sectors of the first track between MBR and the first boot sector (at address 0/0/nn - track/head/sector). While infecting a floppy disk the viruses save the original boot sector to the last sector of the disk root directory. Some viruses of that family save the original boot sector to other sectors of the root directory. The original virus of that family ("Stoned.a") saves the boot and MBR sectors at the addresses: boot - 1/0/3 (head/track/sector), MBR - 0/0/7. 

As a result the viruses may corrupt the data that is placed in these sectors. The address 1/0/3 is correct for 360K floppy disks, but on 1.4M disks that sector is one of the FAT sectors. 

These viruses contain the text strings, in some viruses these strings are encrypted:
